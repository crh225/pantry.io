## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: React components with minimal logic
- **Application Layer**: Redux state management (actions, reducers, selectors)
- **Data Access Layer**: API integration services
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic and utility functions

All files are kept under 50 lines for maximum modularity and maintainability.

## Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Code splitting with React.lazy()
- ✅ Component memoization with React.memo
- ✅ Lazy image loading
- ✅ Redux selector optimization
- ✅ Local storage for pantry persistence

## Security Features

- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ XSS protection (angle bracket removal)
- ✅ Input length limits
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
